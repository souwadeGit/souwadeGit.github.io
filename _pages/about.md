I have worked as a programmer performing COBOL coding and testing on the mainframe using JCL and the Jira Project Management tool. Now, I completed my masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and hope to be an outstanding Data Scientist. I will be able to work on data wrangling, machine learning, exploratory analysis, prediction, and data visualizations using various tools and techniques like statistics, computer programming skills(Python, R, SQL, BI, Tableau...) for any organization in any industry.
